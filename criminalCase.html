                                    <h2 class="mb-4 text-md">What happened on Oct. 16, 2006?</h2>

                                    <p class="lead mb-4">When the police arrived at Bradley Waldroup's trailer home in
                                        the mountains of Tennessee, they found a war zone. There was blood on the walls,
                                        blood on the carpet, blood on the truck outside, even blood on the Bible that
                                        Waldroup had been reading before all hell broke loose.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Waldroup was waiting for his estranged wife to arrive with their four kids for
                                        the weekend. He had been drinking, and when his wife said she was leaving with
                                        her friend, Leslie Bradshaw, they began to fight. Soon, Waldroup had shot
                                        Bradshaw eight times and sliced her head open with a sharp object. When Waldroup
                                        was finished with her, he chased after his wife, Penny, with a machete, chopping
                                        off her finger and cutting her over and over.</p>

                                    <blockquote class="quote">
                                        There are murders and then there are ... hacking to death, trails of blood,"
                                        says prosecutor Cynthia Lecroy-Schemel. "I have not seen one like this. And I
                                        have done a lot."
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p class="lead mb-4 font-weight-normal text-black">Over the fierce opposition of
                                        prosecutors, the judge allowed Bernet to testify in court that these two factors
                                        help explain why Waldroup snapped that murderous night.</p>

                                    <p>And even though prosecutors tried to play down the genetic evidence, Beaty felt it was a major factor.</p>
